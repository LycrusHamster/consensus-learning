HP Paxos
HP Paxos is a hybrid protocol that attempts to combine the best aspects of Classical Paxos, Fast Paxos, and Generalized Paxos. It specifically addresses the practical limitations of Fast Paxos that can render it slower than Classical Paxos and uses Fast Paxos only as an optimization when collisions are absent. When collisions are encountered, it falls back to Classical Paxos which performs better under those circumstances. An additional benefit of HP Paxos is that it supports the Generalized Paxos notion of allowing non-interfering writes to commit without strict ordering requirements.
